Date/Hijri version 0.02
=======================

This simple module converts gregorian dates to islamic (hijri) and
vice versa.

The dates must be given as array containing the day, month and year,
and return the corresponding date as a list with the same elements.

I haven't really tested if the converted dates are right and hope
someone will point out mistakes.

Hijri calculations are very difficult. Please see
http://www.rabiah.com/convert/introduction.html for an explanation.
